Main document <head> and <body> elements can not have more than one main element per page. The role they each play is different. The <head> element is a container for processing information and document metadata. It contains high-level information about the site, and always comes first within the root element. It contains the thoughts of the page. Therefore, the role of the <body> element is where all of the "meat and potatoes" of the site gets placed. This is the data that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the client's local computer. 
The difference between structural and semantic markup is that structural markup is primarily associated with the change in apperance of the document. Therefore, semantic markup is associated with the content rather than its apperance. 
A success I had this week was excelling in my work with my sports marketing internship at the university. One of my challenges this week involved remembering how and where to insert the document elements and meta elements. I overcame this slight challenge by going backwards and doing some research to refresh my memory to stay on track.

    <h3>How to Cook Pasta:</h3>
        <li>1. Cook pasta according to package instructions. Reserve some cooked pasta water. Drain the pasta.</li>
      
     <h3>How to Cook Shrimp:</h3>   
    <ol>
        <!-- used the sup as a semantic element-->
        <li>Note:</li>
    </ol>
        <li>1. if using sun-dried tomatoes in oil (in a jar), make sure to drain sun-dried tomatoes from oil, before using them. Reserve 2 tablespoons of this drained oil for sauteing the shrimp as described below:</li>
        <li>2. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil (reserved from the sun-dried tomatoes jar - see the note above, or use regular olive oil) in a large skillet on medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>3. Add shrimp with minced garlic.  Cook the shrimp on one side for about 1 minute, until shrimp turns pink or golden brown on that side. While it cooks, sprinkle salt over the shrimp to cover every single shrimp.</li>
        <li>4. Make sure not to crowd the shrimp in the skillet, otherwise, moisture will form and shrimp won't sear right. </li>
        <li>5. After 1 minute, flip the shrimp over to the other side and cook for about 30 seconds or 1 minute more. </li>
        <li>6. The shrimp should be golden color or pink on both sides and not overcooked.</li>
        <li>7. Remove the shrimp to a plate, being careful to leave all the oil in the skillet.</li>

    <h3>How to Make Creamy Mozzarella Sauce:</h3>
        <li>1. To the same skillet, add sun-dried tomatoes (drained from oil and sliced into smaller chunks, if needed) and more minced garlic.</li>
        <li>2. Saute sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil (remaining from shrimp) on medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute until the garlic is fragrant. The skillet should be hot.</li>
        <li>3. Add half and half to the hot skillet with sun-dried tomatoes and bring to boil. </li>
        <li>4. Add shredded cheese to the skillet, and quickly stir in while boiling. Immediately reduce to simmer.</li>
        <li>5. Continue cooking the sauce on low simmer heat, constantly stirring, until all the cheese melts and the creamy sauce forms. </li>
        <li>6. If the sauce is too thick, add a small amount of half-and-half or reserved cooked pasta water. </li>
        <li>7. Add basil, crushed red pepper flakes, paprika. Stir.</li>
        <li>8. Add 1/4 teaspoon of salt gradually, stirring on low heat and tasting (you might need slightly less than 1/4 teaspoon).</li>

    <h3>How to Assemble Shrimp Pasta:</h3>
        <li>1. Add cooked pasta to the sauce, and reheat gently on medium heat. </li>
        <li>2. Add the cooked shrimp, stir it in. </li>
        <li>3. Taste, and season with more salt, if needed. </li>
        <li>4. If the sauce is too thick, add a small amount of half-and-half or reserved cooked pasta water. </li>
        <li>5. Let everything simmer on low heat for a couple of minutes for flavors to combine.</li>
    <ol>
        <!-- used the sup as a semantic element-->
        <li>Note:</li>
    </ol>
        <li>6. Make sure to salt the dish just enough to bring out of the flavors of basil and sun-dried tomatoes.</li>

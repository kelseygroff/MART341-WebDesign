    <h1>To the Girl Who is Still Waiting</h1>

        <div class="opening-paragraph">
            Don’t give up. Don’t settle for less. And don’t let the wait drain your desires. 
        </div>
        <div class="second-paragraph">
            For many girls Valentine’s Day is not their favorite holiday. 
            Maybe you see it as a day full of reminders that you are still single.  Maybe it’s a day that reminds you of past relationships. 
            Maybe it’s a day that exposes all the insecurities deep within.
            Maybe it’s a day that you feel lonely. 
            Or maybe, for so many of us, it’s a day that we long to celebrate with a significant other… but are still without one. 
        </div>


        <div>
            Whatever ill-gotten feelings you have towards this holiday let me speak open and honestly with y’all!
            Listen up ladies.
            I HAVE BEEN THERE. 
        </div>


        <div>
            If you know me, you know how much I love love. It is truly my favorite thing. I love to love people. I love to have deep connections. I love to dream about my future relationship and pray for the man God has for me. I love to snuggle up and watch Nicholas Sparks movies with the girls. I love listening to love songs. I love everything about love. 
        </div>


        <div>
            But for a long time, Valentine’s day brought up several emotions that I didn’t love. Loneliness. Hurt. Discontentment. Painful memories. Doubt. 
        </div>


        <div>
            It wasn’t always a holiday that I embraced. In fact, it was quite the opposite. I understand the emotions that can come with this holiday and I get it. But I have good news. It gets better!!!
            And no, I’m not talking about once you find a boyfriend who buys you chocolates and flowers… although we can all agree that will be very nice someday. But for now, I am single, and I am so happy.
        </div>


        <div>
            A year ago, today, I can promise you I wasn’t saying those words. I was a mess, there were so many question marks in my future and my heart was on a platter. But the past year I have truly learned the beauty of being content. 
            And content, to clarify, does not mean that I don’t desire a relationship. Trust me, I do. 
        </div>


        <div>
            Since I was little, I have dreamed of getting married and being a mom. My top two desires in life! But what I have learned this year is that God is preparing me for what He has written on my heart. And preparation takes time. 
            We do not serve a God who dangles a dream in front of us and then never fulfills it.
            If God has placed something on your heart, you better believe that it will come to fruition. Maybe not in your timing and not in the way you pictured. But He will orchestrate everything in HIS perfect timing.  
        </div>


        <div>
            When I began to fully believe that and declare it over my life, that is when I learned the beauty in being content. 
            There are still question marks about my future. There is still so much uncertainty. And I still so desperately desire to fall in love with the man God has chosen for me. But rather than worry about a future that I cannot control; I choose to surrender. 
        </div>


        <div>
            This is not an easy task, I know. 
            Each day I have to actively choose to trust God. 
            Each day I have the choice to give into my emotions and worry, or cling to the promises of God and allow Him to be at the center of my heart. Not every day is easy and sometimes we give into those emotions. But that is the beauty in God. 
        </div>


        <div>
            He is with us in our moments of doubt.
            He is with us in our moments of sadness. 
            He is with us when we let our circumstances dictate our feelings.
            He is with us through it all. 
            And He isn’t scared of our questions. Or our fears. 
        </div>


        <div>
            I have found that in my moments of doubt, God reveals himself to me. 
            His grace is more than we could ever deserve. And His goodness surrounds us.  
        </div>


        <div>
            You may be in a season of waiting. But hold tight. God has handmade a man who will love you, value you, cherish you, and pursue you wholeheartedly. Do not settle for anything less!
            encourage all of you single ladies, keep praying for your future relationship. Keep praying for the desires of your heart. Keep praying for wisdom and guidance. 
        </div>


        <div>
            This season of singleness can feel lonely. It can feel like an eternity. And sometimes it can flat out SUCK! 
            But this season is also an opportunity for you to fully immerse yourself into the presence of God. Allow Him to refine your character and prepare your heart. 
        </div>


        <div>
            Hold onto every lesson. Every valley you’ve walked through. Every trial. Every triumph. 
            Nothing God does is without purpose. You are being prepared for the blessings that are coming. 
            And God is saying to you today… The wait will be worth it!!!!
        </div>

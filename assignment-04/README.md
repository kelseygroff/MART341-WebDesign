Browsers function by the user interface is what's presented to the user to interact with. A browser also has a rendering engine which is responsible for displaying the visual representation of the web page. Next, the browser engine directs action between the rendering engine and interface. To receive its content, the browser must communicate over the network asking for the necessary documents and images that make up the page. Then, to apply interactive logic and functionality, the browser relies on a programming language translater called JavaScript. Finally, the data storage in a browser allows cookies and local storage to retain state even you refresh the page.
Some webbrowsers I use often are Safari and Google Chrome.
A markup language dictates the page's architecture, with a focus on its text content. One commonly used in development is HTML.

I chose to go back to what Google homepage looked like in 2005. The homepage looked very similar to the one we have access to today. The only slight difference in the older one is that the search engines and layouts are boxier. 
My experience with these last few topics has been slightly challenging, but doable. I do not have experience in coding so it has been rewarding to learn something new and watch it progress each week. Within the last few weeks, the main thing I jhave learned is the benefits of knowing how to properly use the 4 main document elemenet. Especially this week, it has been a huge help moving forward. The main thing I am still remembering and learning is the coding symbols used for each element.

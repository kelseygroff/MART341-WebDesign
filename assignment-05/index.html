        Charlotte's Web is a classic children's novel written by American author E.B. White, published in 1952. The novel follows the story of a Wilbur, a pig, and his friendship with Charlotte, a barn spider. Wilbur is born the runt of his litter, and is spared from slaughter by a girl called Fern Arable, who then raises him. When he grows up, he is sold to Fern's uncle, farmer Homer Zuckerman. Lonely, Wilbur is befriended by Charlotte, who lives on a web overlooking his stall in the barn. When Wilbur is in danger of being slaughtered by the farmer, Charlotte writes messages of praise for Wilbur in her webs. This gains Wilbur notoriety and he is entered into the county fair, sparing him from death. At the fair, Charlotte spins and egg sac containing her unborn children. Exhausted by this, she dies, and Wilbur takes over care of the egg. Once born, most of the spiders leave, but three remain to keep Wilbur company.

Universal selectors are used to style every element on a page. The universal selector is the star (*) which is often used to mean "all". Element selectors are used to select all elements of a certain type. This is applied by using an element name.Class selectors are a way to select elements that serve the same function. This is performed by prepending a dot (.) to the front of the class name in the CSS. ID selectors allow developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID. This is performed by prepending a number sign (#).

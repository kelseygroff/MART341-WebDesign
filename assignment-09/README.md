My experience with HTML is all fairly new to me. I never know how complex HTML's are. The main thing I have been finding difficult to learn is the structure of each code to say what I want to say. It is a very specific process. 
With CSS, I am excited to learn more about how the design and content itself is displayed in the next section. It will be exciting to add our own uniqueness to the HTML. 
My challenges and successes varied this week. For instance, there was a lot going on in my life this week so it was hard to prioritize what needed to get done in a timely manner. This lead me to get overwhelmed. Therefore, to overcome this, I took the time out of my day to step back from what I needed to do when I was getting anxious and I took a walk outside. The weather was beautiful this week, so it was very helpful.
